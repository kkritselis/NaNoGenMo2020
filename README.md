# NaNoGenMo2020

## My first attempt at NaNoGenMo

### Day One

I am only going to be able to work on weekends so I am shooting for a project that can be completed in 40 hours.  I also want to have a functioning build that generates 50k words at the end of everyday.  In order to accomplish this I an going use an iterative MVP approach leveraging exisiting text content from APIs and open source database files... adding more content sources to increase the variety and complexity of the generated novel as time allows.

**Research**

My first goal is to identify a broad list of accessable text data stored/generated from APIs and open source database files.  Here is what I got so far:

- Jokes DB
- Quotes DB
- Historical weather API
- Historical news articles DB
- Chat logs DB
- Movie reviews API
- Movie synopsis API
- Yelp reviews API
- Fake user data API
- Song lyrics DB
- Trivia Q&A
- Turn by turn driving instructions
- Dream descriptions DB
- Recipe DB
- Nutritional Info

*The copyright on some of the above material is unknown and would have to be researched or altered before inclusion.

** Ideas **

Brainstorming story ideas that could be augmented by data from one of the above sources... i.e. a character that likes to tell bad 'Dad jokes' would tell a random joke periodically pulled from a DB.

---

**Open Mike Night in Hell**

The protagonist awakes to find himself in a seedy nightclub where a comedy open mike night is just starting... he makes a series of attempts to leave, but all exits lead back to the same room.

**Adventures in Speed Dating**

Two people introduce themselves and talk for a few minutes before a bell rings and it has to start over.  This would allow a lot of opportunity to work in song lyrics, movie trivia, restaurant reviews, bad jokes, etc. The novel tracks three different characters over the course of a number of these speed dating events.

**The Shift**

Two friends pull a 7 hour shift doing food delivery with an uber eats style service.  One drives, the other navigates. The reader would choose a city and the navigators "driving directions" would be genereated from a google maps style 'turn by turn' driving instructions.  Restaurants would be pulled from yelp.  Radio stations, weather, and news could be pulled from real-time local data.

---

**Karaoke Bar**

Told from the point of view of a bartender at a karaoke bar.  Lots of shallow conversational interactions, cocktail recipes, peppered with song lyrics and commentary about the singers.

---

**Groundhog Die**

Write a 'choose your own adventure' style story in an IF engine like Twine with lots of death endpoints and 'build' the novel around forcing the reader to go through most of them before reaching a satisfying ending.  The 'Groundhog Day' conceit would have the reader restarting the novel every time and alternate interactions would have to be written from the 2nd/3rd/etc time through a sections.  

---

**Uniteractive Fiction**

The original interactive fiction game 'Collosal Cave' is open-source and released to the public domain by it author. Repurpose it based on random interactions and movement similar to the above content, only adding the ability to notice and interact with items in a environment.  The original game was only made from about 7000 words, this would have to be enhanced to meet the 50k word goal.

---

**Cataclysm Chronicles**

Cataclysm is an open-source, open world, rouge-like RPG that you could train machine learning to play, record the actions, and generate the novel based on adventure.

**Fianl thoughts before starting**

The game centered approaches would probably produce the most 'readable' content, but would require the most original content creation and would take a lot of work before getting any out put.  The 'Shift' story stikes the right balance between original story and randomized DB/API content, but I fear 40 hours is not long enough to complete it.  Instead, I am going to cobble together a story that starts with a speed dating section, the two hit it off, and wander through the entertainment district stopping at a comedy club and a karaoke bar before calling it a night
