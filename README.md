# NaNoGenMo2020

## My first attempt at NaNoGenMoopen

### Day One

I am only going to be able to work on weekends so I am shooting for a project that can be completed in 40 hours.  I also want to have a functioning build that generates 50k words at the end of everyday.  In order to use an iterative MVP approach leveraging exisiting text content from APIs and open source database files... adding more content sources to increase the variety and complexity of the generated novel as time allows.

** Research **

My first goal is to identify a broad list of accessable text data stored/generated from APIs and open source database files.  Here is what I got so far:

- Jokes DB
- Quotes DB
- Historical weather API
- Historical news articles DB
- Chat logs DB
- Movie reviews API
- Movie synopsis API
- Yelp reviews API
- Fake user data API
- Song lyrics DB
- Trivia Q&A
- Turn by turn driving instructions
- Dream descriptions DB
- Recipe DB
- Nutritional Info
